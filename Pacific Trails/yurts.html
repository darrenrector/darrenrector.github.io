            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
                The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
                running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
